DS4 driver
=================

* DS4 driver is based on the built in Usb Video Class (UVC) driver built in to linux kernel with small required modifications.
* The driver binary name is uvcvideo.ko
* The official Linux UVC documentation is at http://www.ideasonboard.org/uvc/
* The original source is located under the source/drivers/media/usb/uvc dir under the linux kernel tree.
* There are 3 total patches required for ds4. The patches can be categorized into 2 categories:
  1) DS4 specific changes - 1 patch
  2) Required fixes - 2 patches. Those were submitted upstream. They might be already applied to a given kernel

Scripts
================

The patch_ubuntu_uvc.sh script automates downloading ubuntu kernel sources (for the running kernel),
applying patches, and compiling the patched uvc module.

1) Creates a ~/uvc_patch directory
2) Downloads the kernel sources for the running kernel
3) Applies the ds4 patches located in patches subdir
4) Configures the kernel
5) Compiles the uvc module under drivers/media/usb/uvc/

For every specific kernel, slightly different patches might be required,
therefore under the patches dir there are folders containing patches for different running kernels.
Under gmin - are the patches that got merged to gmin Android kernel.

Please create a symbolic link for your running kernel before running the script:

$ cd patches
$ ln -s gmin `uname -r`
$ ls -la
3.13.0-38-generic
*3.13.0-49-generic -> gmin*
gmin


New Pixel Formats:
===================

Those new pixel formats are exposed by the new driver:
+#define V4L2_PIX_FMT_Y8I      v4l2_fourcc('Y', '8', 'I', ' ') /* Greyscale 8-bit L/R interleaved */
+#define V4L2_PIX_FMT_Y12I     v4l2_fourcc('Y', '1', '2', 'I') /* Greyscale 12-bit L/R interleaved */
+#define V4L2_PIX_FMT_Z16      v4l2_fourcc('Z', '1', '6', ' ') /* Depth data 16-bit */

+   /* 10bit raw bayer packed, 5 bytes for every 4 pixels */
+#define V4L2_PIX_FMT_SBGGR10P v4l2_fourcc('p', 'B', 'A', 'A')
+#define V4L2_PIX_FMT_SGBRG10P v4l2_fourcc('p', 'G', 'A', 'A')
+#define V4L2_PIX_FMT_SGRBG10P v4l2_fourcc('p', 'g', 'A', 'A')
+#define V4L2_PIX_FMT_SRGGB10P v4l2_fourcc('p', 'R', 'A', 'A')
